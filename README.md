##Introduction
Meme Runner is my adaptation on a personal favourite of mine: Flappy Bird. This was my first project for my Web Development Immersive at [General Assembly London](https://generalassemb.ly/).

##How to play
At the start of the game you can choose which meme you want as your character, currently there are two memes:

- Doge
- Nyan Cat

To play you can move using either Spacebar or Clicking to jump with your meme.

The aim of the game is to last as long as you can dodging the other meme.

##Technologies used
* Javascript (Including the jQuery library) 
* HTML
* CSS

##If I had more time, I would...
- Style my button better.
- Make it responsive to be able to play on phones.
- Add multiple enemies at one time to make the game harder.
- Fix my button to be able to change memes in between end screens.
- Add more memes as playable characters and enemies.
